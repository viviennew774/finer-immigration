### 

Your business can benefit from employing people from overseas if you need skills that are in short supply, or if you want to discover new ideas and technologies.

You can also employ workers who are living overseas but want to come work in Australia by either:

* Sponsoring a worker on a permanent basis: You can sponsor skilled workers for permanent migration through the [Employer Nomination Scheme](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/employer-nomination-scheme-186) or the [Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/regional-sponsor-migration-scheme-187) (if your business is in regional Australia).
* Sponsoring a worker on a temporary basis: You can sponsor skilled workers for the [Temporary Work (Skilled) Subclass 457 visa](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/repealed-visas/temporary-work-skilled-457), which allows them to come to Australia to work for up to 4 years.
* Entering into a labour agreement: You can employ a number of overseas skilled workers on a permanent or temporary basis by entering into a formal [labour agreement](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/employing-and-sponsoring-someone/sponsoring-workers/nominating-a-position) with the Australian Government.

There are more about the options available to [businesses](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/employing-and-sponsoring-someone/sponsoring-workers/learn-about-sponsoring) on the Department of Immigration and citizenship website.
