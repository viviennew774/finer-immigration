**What should I consider before hiring a Working Holiday Maker?**

* Work should not be the main purpose of the visa-holder's stay. Any work should be secondary to the main purpose of the stay — a holiday.
* The visa holder can only work with the same employer for a maximum of six months.
* The Working Holiday Maker may have extra visa conditions and a breach of any condition could result in the visa being cancelled and the visa holder having to leave Australia.
* Where licensing or registration applies to an occupation (such as health and trade occupations), or other certification is required, you should check that the visa holder has skills to the Australian standard. Employment in the same job in a foreign country does not guarantee skills to the Australian standard.
