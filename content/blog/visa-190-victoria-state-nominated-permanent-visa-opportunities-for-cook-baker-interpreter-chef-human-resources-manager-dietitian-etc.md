The DoHA announced the flexible approach in order to deal with the dilemma amid coronavirus outbreak.   
  
The Doha has advised temporary visa holders can apply for another visa to extend their stay in Australia if they are unable to travel. We understand that the current circumstance has left many temporary visa holders in Australia in a limbo. One of our clients has to reschedule her parents travel due to the restriction of entry imposed by their own country.

Wide- range travel restriction and border control measures imposed across the world, which restricts people’s movements and entry into certain ports, have left many temporary visa holders in Australia in a limbo.  
Her parents were scheduled to return to India via Malaysia, but the Indian government has banned arrivals from Malaysia  
  
My parents are in Australia on a visitor visa which will expire soon. They were supposed to fly back to China, but the government of China has restricted all flights and with the 14 days quarantine attached. What can I do now ? can I get an onshore extension of visitor visa? Melbourne-based Genui shares the same dilemma.

We suggest that every applicant should remain their legal status and extend their visa they are eligible. Or request the waiver if the condition attached before you apply another valid application. The estimated time for processing the condition waiver is 28days.
